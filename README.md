# SSL_Website_CSE389

This is a webserver that I made while part of a team of 3 others.

The server uses the Secure Socket Layer to handle all connections, it was made in Java as a final project for a Web systems Architecture and Programming class (CSE389 @ SU). 
While the actual pages are not well designed, this was not the goal of the project, the backend was the main focus. It uses SSL, Multithreading, Logging, and features an admin authentication page.
